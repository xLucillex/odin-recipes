Final html project

So apparently here I will be practising everything I've seen so far in the html section of The Odin Project by creating a simple website from scratch (no css included yet, but I will be doing that later on). It will be in the form of a recipe website that will include links, images and lists. Hopefully I will not have to refer to the documentation too often. Good luck to me!
